# Sokoban_Py

It's a Sokoban game written with pygame.

Code style is ugly and i don't want to refactor it .

## Usage

install pygame 

    # yum install pygame

clone the repo

    # git clone https://github.com/KIDJourney/Sokoban_Pygame.git

then run the main.py

    # python main.py

## Make your own Change

The image source and map directory is in source and map directory . You can replace them with same size and edit edit the map following rules below.

    N for Nothing

    W for Wall

    G for Goal

    B for Box

    P for the respawn point

Any comment and advice except refactor code .
