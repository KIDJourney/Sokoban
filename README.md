A easy sokoban game with ugly code 
==

(really ugly , sorry for being lazy to refact it)
----

BTW , if you want to edit the map , just open the data file in /map/

N for Nothing
W for Wall
G for Goal
B for Box
P for the respone point

Feel free to edit them because code won't detect whether it's valid XD
